# My C Program Reference
A repository of C programs and idioms for future reference

The exercises are from "C Programming - A Modern Approach" by K. N. King

## Why am I learning C?
Getting the basics right, learning some basic idioms that could be handy. If I know the basics very well then I can apply them to advanced problems knowing what I am actually doing instead of praying to some god that my code works.
